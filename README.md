How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs are best interpreted by focusing on outcomes. User stories are a form of research formatted to relate a problem. "As a...(user) I would like to... (a goal)... so that I can (the benefit).
This format creates a clear and concise user need statement that highlights why a user wants a feature and allows developers to focus on critical features that create the most business value first.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I've never had an approach to developing programs but the core principles of agile seem best. Clearly understanding user needs is foremeost with a strong focus on methods of receiving feedback along with the iterative and incremental development that allows for flexibility and adaptability to changing requirements.


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member is adaptable and flexible, adjusts to new information quickly and communicates efficiently by listening, expressing ideas clearly and sharing knowledge freely. These traits foster trust, improve collaboration and accountability, but most importantly they prioritize working together with others to solve problems quickly and efficiently.
